## Entity - Character

This is the core feature where users build and customize their characters for various projects. The available fields for each character include:
- **CharacterId**: A unique identifier for each character.
- **Name**: The character’s name. (e.g. Bartholomew the IIIrd)
- **Story**: The story that contains the character
- **Description**: The description, or maybe an excerpt of writing, that defines the character.
- **Age**: The character’s age (ranging anywhere from 0 to unknown, to increase the mystery)
- **Background**: A summary of the character’s history and origins, their motivations, and so on.
- **Skills**: Special abilities or talents the character possesses.
- **Strengths**: Key attributes that give the character an edge.
- **Weaknesses**: Areas where the character might struggle.
- **Notable Features**: Distinct traits or appearances that set the character apart.

## Operations

Users can manage their characters with the following options:
- ### Create a Character
Start crafting a new character by filling out key details like name, age, background, and skills. Once saved, the character is added to your roster for future access.

- ### View Details
Review the full profile of any character you’ve created. This feature presents all of the character’s attributes in a clear, organized format, allowing you to quickly reference important details during your projects.

- ### Edit a Character
Modify or update any character’s information as they evolve within your story or campaign. Easily adjust fields like backstory, strengths, or notable features to reflect changes.

- ### Delete a Character
Permanently remove a character from your roster. Before deletion, a confirmation ensures that no data is lost unintentionally, helping you maintain an organized and relevant character list.


## Online and Offline Behavior

- **Online**: All character management operations are available and changes are immediately saved to the server.
- **Offline**: Users can continue interacting with characters, with changes synced once online access is restored. Since this app is meant to increase productivity in a creative field, all operations are going to still be available, with the synchronization with the server is mostly used as a back-up service and as a way to access the data on desktop browsers.
